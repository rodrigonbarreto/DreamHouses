### Amsterdam Houses .Net Exercise
- Determine which real estate agencies in Amsterdam have the most object listed for sale. 
Make a table of the top 10. Then do the same thing but only for objects with a tuin which are listed for sale. 
For the assignment you may write a program in any object oriented language of your choice and you may use any libraries that you find useful.

- On the menu click in **Houses** to list the top 10 real estate agencies in Amsterdam with the most houses listed for sale.

- On the menu click in **Houses with garden** to list the top 10 real estate agencies in Amsterdam with the most houses with garden listed for sale.
- The first time the page load takes a few seconds, after the first load I did a cache with 5 minutes and this makes faster and saves some many requests to the API.
